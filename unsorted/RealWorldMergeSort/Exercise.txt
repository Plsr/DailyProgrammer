Imagine you are an engineer working on some legacy code that has some odd constraints: you're being asked to implement a new function, which basically merges and sorts one list of integers into another list of integers, where you cannot allocate any other structures apart from simple temporary variables (such as an index or counter variable).
You will be given two lists, list A and B, where the elements are positive integers from 1 to 2147483647; the integer '0' is reserved as "buffer space". List A will not be pre-sorted, though list B will be pre-sorted and will start with a series of '0' values. These '0' values are simply reserved space in list B which is the same number of elements that list A has. You cannot modify list A in any way, though list B is fair game. Your goal is to return a merged and sorted list of elements of list A into list B, where you cannot allocate any extra space other than simple / trivial local variables for your function.
